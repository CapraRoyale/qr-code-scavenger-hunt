# ClueHunt-QR
People who like to create scavenger hunts by hiding written clues can't simply track the progress of the players. One issue of this type of game is in Geocaching, which heavily relies on the concept of Global Positioning Systems (GPS). In attempt to resolve this type of issue, our group built a platform to enable a user to set up a scavenger hunt game where the program generates clues which have QR codes on them allowing players to get to the next clue and prove who found it first, thus allowing the creator of the codes to keep track of any player's progress. Primarily the
target audience are people who like outdoor games and have phones with cameras. Also people who have experience with geocaching.

## Progress-Log:
8.3.19 - Formed with Groups and began brainstorming ideas of the type of application we want to deploy. During this time we were eyeing out a scavenger hunt game or creating an AI bot.
8.5.19 - Upon this day, the group has decided to go with making a QR Code scavenger hunt. We began wire-framing as well as researching the type of APIs we would use.
8.8.19 - Our project was set up via github, and Dan was designated as Project manager/coordinator. Everyone within the group created branches and began working on assigned task ranging from developing the <div> elements for the HTML pages, as well as developing the logic/back-end elements for the game.
8.10.19 - From this point we were working on debugging any firebase/javascript issues. Also worked on getting all HTML elements properly linked to one another
8.12.19-8.16.19 - The foundation of the application for both Front-End and Back-End was finalized. As a group the only things we were working on was CSS mobility, as polishing up any issues with the game. (i.e. Creating a function that stops certain pages from having errors due to not loading certain things in time).
8.17.19 - Deployment of application / Presentation to class.
