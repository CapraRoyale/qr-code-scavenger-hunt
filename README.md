# ClueHunt-QR

# Project Title
People who like to create scavenger hunts by hiding written clues can't simply track the progress of the players. One issue of this type of game is in Geocaching, which heavily relies on the concept of Global Positioning Systems (GPS). In attempt to resolve this type of issue, our group built a platform to enable a user to set up a scavenger hunt game where the program generates clues which have QR codes on them allowing players to get to the next clue and prove who found it first, thus allowing the creator of the codes to keep track of any player's progress. Primarily the
target audience are people who like outdoor games and have phones with cameras. Also people who have experience with geocaching.
