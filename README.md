# QR Code Scavenger Hunt

Scavenger hunts can be great fun, offering groups of people the ability to track down items or clues, competing to find all of the items or clues the fastest. The challenge with standard "Hunts" are the ability to track individual progress without a special service and/or GPS.

In an effort to upgrade and simplify the process, our team developed a simple web-based application that allows you to generate as many clues as you like, with an associated QR code that can then be printed and placed where appropriate. When a user scans that QR code, the following clue in the sequence will be revealed, allowing the player to track down the next clue, until eventually reaching the end.

## Progress log

- [X] 8.3.19 - Formed with Groups and began brainstorming ideas of the type of application we want to deploy. During this time we were eyeing out a scavenger hunt game or creating an AI bot.
- [x] 8.5.19 - Upon this day, the group has decided to go with making a QR Code scavenger hunt. We began wire-framing as well as researching the type of APIs we would use.
- [x]8.8.19 - Our project was set up via github, and Dan was designated as Project manager/coordinator. Everyone within the group created branches and began working on assigned task ranging from developing the \<div> elements for the HTML pages, as well as developing the logic/back-end elements for the game.
- [x] 8.10.19 - From this point we were working on debugging any firebase/javascript issues. Also worked on getting all HTML elements properly linked to one another
- [x] 8.12.19-8.16.19 - The foundation of the application for both Front-End and Back-End was finalized. As a group the only things we were working on was CSS mobility, as polishing up any issues with the game. (i.e. Creating a function that stops certain pages from having errors due to not loading certain things in time).
- [x] 8.17.19 - Deployment of application / Presentation to class.
